# Interactive Form
 In this project, I’ll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form. Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I’ll add my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by: 
 
 * Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity. 
 * Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
 * Providing form fields that have real-time validation and conditional error messages
